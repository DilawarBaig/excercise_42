//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


let magicians:string[] = ["Chriss Angle","Dynamo","David Blaine"];

function show_magicians (magician:string[]):void {
    for(let i = 0; i < magicians.length;i ++){
        console.log(`The great ${magician[i]}.`)
    }
}
show_magicians(magicians)
